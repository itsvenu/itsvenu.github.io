      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Feb 11th, my twitter feed flooded with totally a new set of tweets which have &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#WomenInScience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A hashtag to celebrate women &amp;amp; girls in science. Celebrating women &amp;amp; girls in science started in 2015 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://womeninscienceday.org&#34;&gt;https://womeninscienceday.org&lt;/a&gt;), which should have started hundreds of years earlier. Yes, something was terribly wrong in history. Good thing is, itâ€™s changing rapidly and many more women are raising to the top in STEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb 11th, I was checking my twitter feed once in a while during the day. A lot of women from STEM tweeted personal experiences, struggles faced, showing gratitude to the people who helped them to stand their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a data scientist (&lt;em&gt;yeah, I call myself that&lt;/em&gt;), I was really inspired and at the same time fascinated to visualize all locations around the world where these tweets are coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;womeninscienceday-around-the-world&#34;&gt;#WomenInScienceDay around the world&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without much explanation, here is the plot with unique locations around the world (indicated by red dot) from where people talked about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#WomenInScienceDay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Feb 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./wis.png&#34; alt=&#34;wis&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one can do a lot of analysis on social interactions &amp;amp; visualize connections among different countries, e.g. a tweet originated from a country (node) and retweeted by people from other countries (edges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested to continue the analysis, data, code and techinical details are available here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/itsvenu/womenInScienceDay&#34;&gt;https://github.com/itsvenu/womenInScienceDay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
